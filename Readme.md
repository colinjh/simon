#Simon - Project Zero part 2

Alternative Project

I wanted to do something other than tic tac toe.
The initial code for my tic tac toe was done working with Harry so I wanted to do something full by myself

##Sticking Points

* Audio delay - big thanks to Jack for helping me with thsi.
* CSS - I learnt alot about positioning doing this but still have a lot of work to do
